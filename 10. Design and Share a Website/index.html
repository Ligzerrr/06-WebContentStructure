    <h1>Healthy Lifestyle</h1>
    
    <h2>Our health is extremely important!</h2>
    <p>We often forget to practice good habits that improve our overall health. This short post should steer you in the right direction of improving
        your lyfestyle!
    </p>

    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Make sure to remember to eat lots of fruit and vegetables. They contain important vitamins and nutrients that normally
        aren't able to be obtained anywhere else, like vitamin B6 (which is important for brain health) or fiber (which is much appreciated by our bowels).
        Always eat in moderation and don't harm your mental health after eating one burger as an occasion. Make sure to appreciate what you are eating!
        You can always refer to websites like these: <a href="https://www.healthyfood.com/" alt="healthyfood">Healthyfood</a> to learn more about good eating habits.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Make sure to get some exercise during the day. It's needed for a good blood flow, and it also improves mental stability. If you are often sitting down
        never forget to stand up at least every 30 minutes. Here's a site that lists good quick 5 minute exercises: <a href="https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/5-minute-full-body-workout" alt="mindbodygreen.com">mindbodygreen.com</a>.

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Make sure to always sleep at least 7-8 hours a day, rest is always productive as it helps our bodies regenerate. Stick to a good sleep schedule.
        You can find out more about the human circadian clock in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep" alt="sleep">wikipedia</a> article.
